# Downsamplign datasets instructions

Copy and paste the scripts `downsample_all.sh` and `downsample_folder.sh` into the `point_clouds_registration_benchmark` folder

Go into the benchmark folder and run `bash downsample_all.sh VOXEL_SIZE`.
The script will create a folder called `dataset_voxelgrid_VOXELSIZE`, containing the downsampled datasets and the corresponding txt files with the downsampling time for each sequence.
