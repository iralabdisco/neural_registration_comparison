# Scripts to extract features using FPFH

Use `run_registration_global.py` to extract the features for all the benchmark problems.
Modify the BENCHMARK_DIR to the path of the benchmark and RESULTS_DIR to the path where you want to save the features.
Notice that the BENCHMARK_DIR should point to the pre-downsampled datasets.
You also need to modify the VOXEL_SIZE to reflect the downsampling voxel size used.
