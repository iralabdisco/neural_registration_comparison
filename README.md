[Assessing the Practical Applicability of Neural-Based Point Clouds Registration Algorithms: A Comparative Analysis](https://www.authorea.com/doi/full/10.22541/au.168908592.24833908/v1)

This work compares different neural network-based algorithms for point clouds registration on our [Point Clouds Registraion Benchmark](https://github.com/iralabdisco/point_clouds_registration_benchmark).
The results of the registration problems can be found in the 'results' folder, divided by algorithm used. In each leaf folder, a file with the '_config.json' suffix can be found, stating the parameters used for the registration.
